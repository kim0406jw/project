# Goal
The goal of this project is to convert low-resolution image files to high-resolution image files using deep learning techniques.

The super-resolution algorithm is expected to have a myriad of applications in various fields of industry. One example would be CCTV for crime prevention purposes. If we use low-resolution CCTV, the image of people's faces can't be distinguishable in some cases. This image is unhelpful. However, the situation will be different if low-resolution images are converted into high-resolution images using the software implemented in this project.
